# MatLab-Project-SEMS
This project consists of two parts. 
The first one is the Smart Energy Management System "SEMS" created in MatLab AppDesigner.
The SEMS consists of renewable and traditional energy sources feeding the loads and allowing small VPP functions to sell and purchase energy from other power clouds.
A power cloud in the SEMS is the battery. 
The App is a human machine interface visualizing the communication between the participating components.
Next, the nano grid file created in MatLab Simulink is the actual electric circuit applying the SEMS theory/App to reality.
The simulation results show the efficient management of the system allows a reduction of CO2 while energy costs can be saved.
